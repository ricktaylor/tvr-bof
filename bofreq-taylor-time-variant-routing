# Name: Time Variant Routing (TVR)

## Description

Existing Routing Protocols expect to maintain contemporaneous,
end-to-end connected paths across a network. Changes to that
connectivity, such as the loss of an adjacent peer, are considered to be
exceptional circumstances that must be corrected through revised path 
computation.

However, there are a growing number of use-cases where changes
to the routing topology are an expected part of network operations. In these
cases the pre-planned loss and restoration of an adjacency, or formation of
an alternate adjacency, should be seen as a non-disruptive event.

The expected loss (or planned activation) of links can occur for a
variety of reasons. In networks with mobile nodes, such as unmanned
aerial vehicles and some orbiting spacecraft constellations, links are
lost and re-established as a function of the mobility of the platforms.
In networks without reliable access to power, such as networks
harvesting energy from wind and solar, link activity might be restricted
to certain times of day. Similarly in networks prioritizing green
computing and energy efficiency over data rate, network traffic might be
planned around energy costs or expected user data volumes.

The Time Variant Routing Working Group (TVR-WG) will be chartered to
develop a common set of definitions, attributes, architectures, behaviors, and
algorithms necessary to evaluate routing and forwarding decisions in the
presence of planned loss or activation of network connectivity based on
confirmed scheduled events. The WG may also address the impacts of a 
continually changing topology upon the hierarchical structure of the network.

The outputs of the TVR-WG will be reviewed by, and provided to, other
Routing Area Working Groups so that time-variant attributes and
behaviors can be appropriately incorporated into individual routing
protocols by the relevant Working Groups.
