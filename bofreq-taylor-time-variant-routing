# Name: Time Variant Routing (TVR)

## Description

Existing Routing Protocols expect to maintain contemporaneous,
end-to-end connected paths across a network. Changes to that
connectivity, such as the loss of an adjacent peer, are considered
exceptional circumstances corrected through revised path computation.

However, a growing number of use cases exist where planned changes
to the routing topology are an expected part of network operations. In these
cases, the pre-planned loss and restoration of an adjacency, or formation of
an alternate adjacency, should be seen as a non-disruptive event.

The expected loss (or planned activation) of links can occur for
various reasons. For example, in networks with mobile nodes, such as
aerial vehicles and some orbiting spacecraft constellations, links are
lost and re-established as a function of their mobility.
Similarly, network traffic might be planned around energy costs or
expected user data volumes in networks prioritizing green computing and
energy efficiency over data rate.

The Time Variant Routing Working Group (TVR WG) is chartered to
develop a common set of definitions, attributes, architectures, behaviors, and
algorithms necessary to evaluate routing and forwarding decisions in the
presence of planned loss or activation of network connectivity based on
scheduled events. The WG may also address the impacts of a
continually changing topology on the hierarchical structure of the network.

The outputs of the TVR WG will be reviewed by, and provided to, other
Routing Area Working Groups.  If needed, the relevant Working Groups can
incorporate time-variant attributes and behaviors into individual routing
protocols.
